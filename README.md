# General Auth System

A reusable, scalable, and modular full-stack authentication boilerplate built with the MERN stack. This project includes features such as OTP verification, login throttling, token expiration, and more â€” designed to help backend developers quickly implement secure authentication.

## Features

- **OTP (One-Time Password) Verification** for user signup and login security
- **Login Throttling** to prevent brute-force attacks
- **Token Expiration** management with JWT for secure session handling
- Modular and reusable backend and frontend architecture
- Easy to integrate into other projects or use as a starter template

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OTP via email
- **Others:** Nodemailer for sending emails

## Getting Started
